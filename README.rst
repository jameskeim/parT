parT Paragraph Formatter
========================

``parT`` is a fork of the wonderful ``par`` tool
beloved by Vim and console users since 1993.

``parT`` is based on Par 1.52, Copyright 2001 by Adam M. Costello.

Unfortunately, the original ``par`` takes a hardline on tabs.
Says the original author,

::

    In my opinion, the world would be a nicer place if everyone stopped
    using tabs, so I'm doing my part by not letting par output them.

The ``parT`` fork replaces acceptance of tabs, because sometimes you
work on other people's code and you don't have a choice, and mostly
because they're shouldn't be a religion behind one person's choice of
leading whitespace.
